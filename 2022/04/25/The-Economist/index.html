<p>In 1993 A region of the human genome called xq28 was linked to male homosexuality, and the controversial notion of a “gay gene” was born.</p>
<p>genome 基因组</p>
<p>the controverisal notion of 有争议的观点</p>
<p>Those research finding have not been replicated.</p>
<p>But it was never going to be that simple: decades of genetic research have shown that almost every human characteristic is a complex interplay of genes and environmental factors.</p>
<p>A new study, published in Science this week, confirms that this is the case for human sexuality, too.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Study, the largest ever into this difficult topic, was conducted by an international group of scientists working with 23andMe, a personal genomics firm.</p>
<p>It used what is called a genome-wide association study(GWAS) on 408995 individuals in the UK Biobank, a British health resource, and 68527 American 23andMe users - all of whom remained anonymous and consented to the study.</p>
<p>consent 同意 赞同</p>
<hr>
<p>A GWAS involves scanning a person’s DNA for tiny variations in the genetic code that correlate with a given trait.</p>
<p>variation 变更</p>
<p>The participants were divided on the basis of whether they answered yes or no to the question “Have you ever had sex with someone of the same sex?” - a woolly proxy for sexual orientation, even in the absence of littile white lies.</p>
<p>The figures the GWAS produced, therefore, relate only to a single act, not to whether someone indentifies as gay.</p>
<hr>
<p>The researchers found five genetic markers that were significantly associated with a reported homosexual act by one of the participants in the study.</p>
<p>None of those markers was on the X or Y sex chromosomes and their total combined effect acounted for less than 1% of the variance.</p>
<p>chromosome 染色体</p>
<p>This is because the behaviour is the result of th eggregate effort of hundereds or thousands of genes, whose individual effects are infinitesimally weak.</p>
<p>infinitesiomally 极小的</p>
<p>Totting up all the thousands of tested genetic variants accounted for between 8% and 25% of the variation in people’s self-reported homosexual acts.</p>
<p>totting up 加起来</p>
<p>These variants also overlapped with other traits, such as smoking and an  openness to new experiences.</p>
<p>overlap with 重叠</p>
<hr>
<p>Interestingly, only about 60% of the genetic variants indentified in the study were shared by both sexes.</p>
<p>Most behaviours show more overlap between the sexes than this, intimating that male and female homosexuality, or at least sexual adventures, maybe quite different.</p>
<p>intimating that 暗示</p>
<p>David Curtis of University College London notes that what overlap there is “suggests that there could be specific factors affecting same-sex attraction rather than simply being attracted to males versus being attracted to females.”</p>
<p><strong>The riddles go on</strong></p>
<p>Conscious of the tricky subject matter, the scientists are at pains to anticipate any misunderstand and backlash.</p>

<p>Yet the research only scrapes the surface of the mysterious depths of human sexuality.</p>
<p>scrape the surface 表面</p>
<p>Unravelling these riddles will be difficult and will inevitably beget misconception and controversy.</p>
<p>But at least this study should add weight to the view that nonheterosexual behaviour is firmly within the normal, natural spectrum of human diversity and provide a firm foundation for future work.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Elon-Musk-has-learned-to-lova-China"><a href="#Why-Elon-Musk-has-learned-to-lova-China" class="headerlink" title="Why Elon Musk has learned to lova China"></a>Why Elon Musk has learned to lova China</h2><p>William bin li is as close as China may have come to cloning Elon Musk. The founder of Nio,  a <strong>swanky</strong> electric-vehicle (ev) company, is in his 40s, <strong>a tech nerd</strong>, and though not as meme-able as the founder of Tesla, is treated like a rock star by his adoring customers. Nio, worth $4bn, <strong>is a fraction of</strong> the size of Mr Musk’s Tesla, valued at $75bn, but of all China’s 30-odd ev <strong>startups</strong>, it is the best known. It also raises and dashes investors’ hopes with Tesla-like frequency. On December 30th Nio’s shares <strong>soared</strong> 54% when Mr Li said output had probably reached 8,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter from almost 4,800 in the third. But over the whole of 2019 they lost almost 40% (see chart). </p>
<p>Not  long  ago  Nio <strong>was  considered  the  more  promising  of  the two</strong>. In the world’s largest car market, where sales of luxury vehicles are <strong>booming</strong>, it got its start in 2014 when state and local governments were throwing <strong>subsidies</strong> at both buyers and manufacturers of evs. <strong>Venture-capital backing</strong> was abundant. Nio delivered its first commercial car, the ES8 suv priced at <strong>above</strong> $70,000, in 2018. <strong>Shortly afterwards</strong> it issued shares on the New York Stock Exchange, both to raise money and to heighten its international profile so that it  could  sell cars around the world.  Its shareholders include  Baillie  Gifford,  an  Edinburgh-based  fund manager that is <strong>the largest institutional investor</strong> in Tesla.</p>
<p>Tu Le of Sino Auto Insights, an advisory firm, says Nio’s Tesla-killing <strong>aspirations</strong> got the better of it, though. It was <strong>rash</strong> to think it could quickly take on a firm 11 years older with <strong>huge global brandrecognition</strong>  and  several  models.  Nio’s  <strong>revenues</strong>,  estimated at around $1.2bn for 2019, <strong>are dwarfed by</strong> the $24bn projected for Tesla. Yet since the start of 2017 its <strong>cumulative</strong> losses have overtaken those of Tesla (see chart). Nio has <strong>splashed out on spacious stores</strong> with libraries, coffee shops and crèches, sometimes directly across the street from Tesla showrooms. But unlike Tesla it has not invested much in factories, <strong>contracting manufacturing to</strong> jac Motors, astate-owned carmaker, instead. </p>
<p>Furthermore, <strong>a cut in state subsidies for ev purchases</strong> since June has hurt investor <strong>sentiment</strong>, prompting fears of a funding crunch. Nio raised $100m from Tencent, the tech giant that <strong>is alsoone of</strong> its leading shareholders, in the third quarter, and Mr Li is expected to <strong>pitch in</strong> as much himself. But Nio burned through evenmore than that in the third quarter and has net debt of $1.3bn, according to Bernstein, an investment firm. Though Nio’s sales rose 22.5% in the third quarter compared with the previous three months, and it launched a third suv on December 28th, it admits it needs funding if it is to survive for another year.</p>
<p><strong>Given the precarious circumstances</strong>, the Chinese government might be expected to <strong>throw Nio a lifeline</strong>. Instead, it is Tesla that is getting the breaks. On December 30th, the day of Nio’s <strong>relief rally</strong>, the first Model 3s <strong>rolled out</strong> from Tesla’s Gigafactory in Shanghai, costing a mere $50,000 each. Though work started on the plant less than a year ago, production is already running at about 1,000 cars a week. Days before, the American firm received $1.3bn worth of funding from Chinese lenders to complete the Shanghai-based factory. Production in China <strong>spares</strong> Tesla from <strong>import tariffs on finished vehicles</strong>, and its locally made cars also <strong>qualify for subsidies</strong>. Its shares have soared to <strong>record highs</strong> in recent days, though there are still <strong>nagging doubts</strong> about its ability to <strong>increase volumes, margins and cash generation</strong>. <strong>Perversely</strong>, Tesla may even have benefited from China’s trade war with America. The government hopes to <strong>portray</strong> Tesla’s investment, the first fully foreign-owned car plant in China, as a symbol of its openness.</p>
<p>Nio, despite being Chinese, does not offer the same <strong>geopolitical advantages</strong>, and without its own factories it has less <strong>leverage</strong> when asking state governments to support it. As Michael Dunne, the Tesla-driving boss of ZoZo Go, a car advisory firm, puts it, “Nio doesn’t have a clear-cut godfather in the Chinese government.” It is competing with <strong>a host of</strong> ev startups, such as Byton, wm and Xpeng, for funding. There is no guarantee all of them will survive. In this <strong>fraught</strong> market, fortunes could quickly reverse again. Nio says it may soon announce new funding arrangements. A state-backed carmaker could take a big stake in it. Some analysts say it is unlikely the government will let Nio <strong>go bust</strong>, because it is such a symbol of China’s technological ambitions.</p>
<p>So much giga and greater than America For now, though, Tesla is in <strong>pole</strong> position. In fact, says Mr Dunne, China must already feel like home to Mr Musk. The government’s ev ambitions give Tesla a <strong>tailwind</strong> that it lacks in America; on January 1st its customers there stopped benefiting from a tax credit. Consumers love luxury-car brands; Tesla’s main competition will be with <strong>Germany’s premium carmakers</strong>, not Chinese ones. China’s manufacturing prowess will help Tesla overcome the “production hell” it suffered back home. And China may be quicker to encourage <strong>autonomous driving</strong> than America. For Mr Musk, the main <strong>drawback</strong> could be that Twitter, his favoured megaphone, is blocked behind the great firewall. But for Tesla that too must be a <strong>blessed relief</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Johnson-Double-Talk"><a href="#Johnson-Double-Talk" class="headerlink" title="Johnson Double Talk"></a>Johnson Double Talk</h2><p><strong>It helps to speak more than one language—even if the benefits are unquantifiable.</strong></p>
<p>Just a few generations ago, speaking two languages was supposed to be bad for you. Tests in America found that <strong>bilingual</strong> people had lower IQs, which seemed evidence enough. Later it became clear that those surveys were really measuring the material poverty of immigrants; members of such families were more likely to be <strong>undernourished</strong> and understimulated, not to mention the obvious fact that they often <strong>sat the tests</strong> in a language that was not their best.</p>
<p>How things have changed. In the past decade it has become almost common knowledge that <strong>bilingualism</strong> is good for you — <strong>witness articles</strong> such “Why Bilinguals are Smarter” and “The Amazing Benefits of Being Bilingual” by the New York Times and the BBC. <strong>Stacks of</strong> research papers have suggested that twotongued people enjoy <strong>a variety of</strong> <strong>nonlinguistic</strong> advantages. Most <strong>notably</strong>, they have shown that bilinguals get <strong>dementia</strong> on average four years later than monolinguals, and that they have an edge in “executive control”—<strong>a basket of abilities</strong> that <strong>aid</strong> people doing complex tasks, including focusing attention, ignoring irrelevant information and updating working memory.</p>
<p>Why bilingualism would enhance these capabilities is unclear. Researchers hypothesise that having two languages means <strong>suppressing</strong> one when speaking the other, a kind of constant mental exercise that makes the brain healthier. <strong>This in particular is</strong> thought to be behind the finding of <strong>a later onset of dementia</strong>. But as intellectual <strong>pendulums</strong> do, this one has begun to swing again, against the “bilingual advantage”. Though many papers have identified such a bonus, many more have tried and failed to replicate those studies. Roberto Filippi of University College London and his colleagues have spent five years testing more than 600 people, from seven to 80 years old and including some who <strong>oscillate</strong> between two languages. They could find no statistically significant advantage in <strong>any age cohort</strong>.</p>
<p>In response to the <strong>scepticism</strong>, researchers who believe in the advantage have <strong>refined</strong> their studies — now acknowledging that, beneath their common trait, bilingual people use their languages in varying ways that may account for the <strong>incongruent</strong> previous results. Does speaking two very distinct languages have a different effect from speaking two very similar ones? What about two <strong>dialects</strong>? Does speaking more than two provide any additional benefit? Does it matter if subjects live among people who speak their first language or their second? </p>
<p>A recent study by four researchers at the University of the Balearic Islands is a good example. They studied 112 bilinguals using three <strong>criteria</strong>: the age they acquired a second language; fluency in their two languages (most are not equally <strong>adept</strong> in both); and the frequency with which they switch between the two options. Frequency of switching, it turned out, was the variable that correlated best with improved executive control. Unlike Mr Filippi’s, other studies have <strong>hinted</strong> that frequent switching may be a good predictor of the bilingual advantage.</p>
<p>On balance, it seems that if the <strong>dividend</strong> is real, it is <strong>subtle</strong> and affected by many other factors. Though wealthy parents have been taken by the notional leg-up, hiring foreign <strong>nannies</strong> for their <strong>offspring</strong> and so on, it may be poorer individuals who get the biggest benefit. A study in Hyderabad, for instance, reproduced the finding of a four-year delay <strong>in the onset of</strong> dementia among bilinguals — except that the gap was six years for those test cases who were <strong>illiterate</strong>. If switching languages is healthy mental exercise, other highly skilled, <strong>cognitively demanding kinds of labour</strong> are likely to provide good work-outs, too. People who do other forms of mental multitasking all the time may not get such a big lift from bilingualism, if they get any at all.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that learning another language (or teaching a child one) sometimes <strong>confers</strong> an intellectual boost, though not always. But that has never been the main reason to do it. A second language expands the number of people you can talk to. It adds to the ways you can say things, and so offers a second point of view on the whole business of expression. Bilingualism may help you understand other people; one study found that bilingual children are better at <strong>grasping other perspectives</strong>, perhaps because they are always keeping track of who speaks what, a regular reminder that everyone is different. Finally, speaking a second language less well than your first supplies another kind of useful practice: it is a constant exercise in humility.</p>
